## 1. Introduction
Project made in Vanilla Javascript for study purposes, with the idea of recreating a classic game called [Super Collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collapse!)

## 2. Interface Access
The application which can be viewed in this [Link](https://super-collapse-game-eqgdweouy-kamilamoura1.vercel.app/).
It is recommended to play from the desktop.

## 3. Future implementation
- [ ] New random tiles are added to the bottom of the grid every second, pushing everything up.
Player loses if the tiles reach the top of the grid
- [ ] Tiles fall down due to gravity, leaving no empty spaces in between tiles.
- [ ] If a full column in the middle is cleared, then the remaining tiles shift towards the center to
cover the empty column.
- [ ] Player wins if there are no more matches available after 100 lines have been added.

## 4. Project Installation
If you want to download the project to your desktop it is possible to create a fork of the repository and after that, you should perform a "clone" or "donwload" of the **link provided by your repository** then type in your terminal:

  `git clone <collect your link after that>`
  
The repository will be completely downloaded on your machine.

If you don't have Node.js installed, just click on this link [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and download it, because to run it on your computer, you will need to perform the node modules folder installation, using NPM (native Node.js).

Once the installation is complete, just type in your terminal:

`npm install` 

And wait until the process is complete.
